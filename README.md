# Dutch and English Auctioning System
This java program will initaite Buyer and Seller agents which can communicate and carry out auctioning of fish, like in a Fishmarket.


I assume you are using a standard bash terminal, and have Java installed(preferably version 8)
To run the program:

1. Clone the repo
2. While inside the repo make sure you can executing bash scripts by setting ```chmod +x filename.sh```
3. Once you did step 2 for whichever ```.sh``` file, run it using ```./filename.sh```
